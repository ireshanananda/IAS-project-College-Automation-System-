<p><h4>Department of Computing and Information Systems</h4>
The Department of Computing and Information Systems at the Faculty of Applied Sciences, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka was established in 2011, while the BSc Hons Degree Programme in Computing and Information Systems was initiated back in 2008. Embarking on software engineering education, the Department marked another milestone introducing BSc Hons Degree Programme in Software Engineering for the academic year 2019/20.

At present, the Department is empowered with a highly qualified and competent panel of academic staff including one professor in Computer Science, five senior lecturers, and seven lecturers. Meanwhile, eminent senior academics and industrialists are contributing as visiting professionals in conducting lectures and practical sessions in the respective disciplines.

The Department is equipped with physical facilities including five well-established computer laboratories, a research unit, and an industrial training unit. It maintains close collaborations with the industry which has enabled to secure opportunities for the undergraduates for early industrial exposure and employment upon graduation. Today, the Department is successfully progressing introducing numerous initiatives for research and knowledge dissemination including the International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC), the Sabaragamuwa University Journal of Computer Science (SUJCS) and the ComSpective the ICT Technical Magazine. The undergraduates are actively involved in numerous extra-curricular activities as the Society of Computer Sciences (SOCS), IEEE Student Branch of SUSL, and IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) Affinity Group - the newest addition. Drawing its collective effort and expertise, the Department also plays a pioneering role in ensuring a high-quality education at SUSL in a scenario of digital transformation amid the present-day challenges.

The Faculty of Applied Sciences has a mandate for 238 student intake (180 for Information Systems (IS) and 58 for Software Engineering (SE)) for the academic year 2019/20. While the IS Degree Programme has reached the maximum capacity, the Department is pleased to announce that the introduction of a new BSc Hons Degree Programme in Data Science is also in progress. Accordingly, the university in its Action Plan has identified the need of establishing a Faculty of Computing at SUSL.

From its inception, throughout its journey for more than a decade, the Department of Computing and Information Systems has produced over 500 graduates, securing above 90% employability.   365 undergraduates are currently reading for the degrees, the curricula of which are designed complying with SLQF Level 6 and ACM/ IEEE guidelines, which has enabled to produce competent graduates demanded by today's IT/BPM industry. The degree programmes also pave an excellent pathway for postgraduate studies.</p>
